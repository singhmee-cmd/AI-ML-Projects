            "Content: No. Subject Clause(s) being addressed Rationale Where included Clarification Scope Order of precedence does not include Accenture’s proposal. Preface para 4 Our Proposal is consistent with your RFP as clarified and set out herein. Notwithstanding anything in the Conditions of Contract or Letter of Acceptance including any subsequent clarifications in relation to order of precedence, in the event of ambiguity, or conflict, Accenture’s Proposal shall prevail. Scope Mitigate scope creep where scope description is open ended. Accenture does not provide any legal, accounting, audit, tax or other similar professional advice, or guarantee that our proposed services will enable Client to meet applicable legal or regulatory standards. Accenture may request for a variation to the Contract in the event that there are changes to the assumptions or clarifications in this Proposal (e.g. inclusion of features that are not provided by the Cloud Service Provider, or due to sizing or obsolescence). Accenture would discuss and agree with Client on the scope of work that may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of the Contract. To clarify, Accenture would correct all material and functional deficiencies and errors within Accenture’s scope of work, so that the agreed specifications under the Contract would be met. Client obligations N.A. No client obligations currently included. Client is responsible for determining whether any services and deliverables provided by Accenture: (a) comply with all laws and regulations applicable to Client and its use of the services and deliverables, (b) comply with any other agreements Client has with, or requirements or guidelines by any other third parties. Client will provide timely access to relevant documentation and information necessary for performing project activities. Any delays or failure by Client to perform its obligations or responsibilities may result in additional fees to Client. Accenture may not independently validate any information provided to it by Client, its agents or third parties and would rely upon the accuracy and completeness of such information. The success of any complex information technology implementation is always a collaborative effort. We will require the Client’s commitment to provide the right project team members, materials, and/or resources to work with us to meet the timelines. Subcontractors Upfront approval for subcontractors Accenture will use the following subcontractors: Accenture Affiliates . Please let us know before tender award if you have any concerns. Third parties / FIN45 To facilitate contracting with third party vendors using PAM. Accenture will only be responsible for application software components solely developed, licensed or subcontracted by it, and as described in our Proposal. Client will contract directly with the third-party vendors for the purchase of third-party hardware & software (including any third party IP) and related services and support.  Client will be responsible for the relationship and contractual obligations with the relevant third party vendors (including any End-User Licence Agreements or Terms of Service, etc). Client will select the products and services including quantity and price, to meet its requirements and Accenture may, on the Client’s written request, help purchase the third party products and services as set out in(collectively “Products”) as the Client’s procurement agent.  Accenture’s sole responsibility is to pay the third party vendor after receiving payment from Client and to track and report Product issues and facilitate any workaround or resolution by the relevant vendor. The Client shall, independent of Accenture’s Services, pay Accenture the Product fees as set out , which  Accenture’s agency fees, within 30 days upon receiving the Products and related invoice. The breakdown on Accenture’s agency fees will not be made available to Client. The relevant vendor shall be directly liable to the Client for the Products pursuant to separate terms agreed between the vendor and Client (“Vendor Terms”) and title, licences and/or warranties for the Products (as applicable) shall be provided based on the relevant Vendor Terms. Where third party services include customization to the third-party products, this may constitute third party’s background IP. Third party vendor may have a direct recourse to Client (if Accenture did not pay third party vendor on time due to failure to have received the sums due by Client to third party vendor) and Client should make related payments. A Vendor-managed update approach means the Cloud Vendor / Cloud Service Provider would automatically update a customer's application (and supporting infrastructure) as part of a subscription. Maintenance of the Cloud Service may result in scheduled downtime. Accenture clarifies that if the Client procures the Cloud Service directly, Accenture’s role would be solely to function as a liaison point of contact, to facilitate workarounds. Accenture would not be managing the Cloud Service Provider as a principal. IP IP clarifications Accenture clarifies that all Background IP (including any modifications or enhancements) will remain owned by the originating party. Use of Accenture’s and Accenture’s sub-contractors’ assets (if any) may be subject to additional terms to be provided separately. Client shall promptly notify Accenture in writing of any infringement claims. Accenture’s will not apply if any infringement claim results from Client’s (i) misuse or modification of the System, (ii) failure to use corrections or enhancements made available by Accenture, (iii) use of the System in combination with any product or information not owned or developed by Accenture, or (iv) any third party’s information, direction, specification or materials. Limitation of liability Limitation of liability. Accenture clarifies that it only be liable to Client for direct losses in the event of any claims (including data or security concerns), provided such total losses will not exceed: (1) for system implementation, the total fees received by Accenture for system implementation (excluding third party products and services); and (2) for maintenance and operations support, the fees paid for Accenture’s services during the  twelve (12) months prior to the incident giving rise to such liability or the total maintenance and operations support fees received by Accenture if maintenance has been in effect for less than twelve (12) months (excluding third party products and services), whichever is the subject of the claim. Accenture shall not be liable for acts or omissions of Client or third parties, or for third party products. Accenture does not represent or warrant that any third party products, service or documentation would be free from defects or vulnerabilities. Acceptance test Clarity on Acceptance Tests During delivery, parties would work on a Project Management Plan which will include agreed deliverables and acceptance criteria, process.  Any modification to agreed acceptance test procedures/plan would be subject to the change control process. Termination Client has broad termination rights, but no right for Accenture to terminate. Pricing Assumptions Upon any termination of the Contract by the Client for any reasons, Accenture shall be paid for all services and deliverables rendered up to the effective date of termination, as well as any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Accenture, including work in progress and demobilization costs. Implicit security obligations N.A. Implicit security carve-outs Save as expressly set out otherwise in the proposal, Accenture’s scope of Services excludes security services, including, but not limited to, managed security services, cyber defense services (such as threat hunting and incident response services), or any monitoring, scanning, testing assessments or remediations for security vulnerabilities in Client’s environments. The Services are not intended to detect all security or network threats or vulnerabilities of Client’s systems or prevent intrusions or damage to Client’s network or operations. Accenture shall use reasonable efforts to perform virus scans using then current industry-standard antivirus programs on all tools and software which Accenture may use to perform the Contract. If unauthorised code is discovered to have been introduced by Accenture, Accenture will promptly take reasonable steps to remove it and Accenture’s liability shall be limited to the cost of recovery of any lost / damaged data from the date of latest back-up maintained. Accenture will work with and rely on Client to obtain from Client and its third parties all necessary authorizations and consents for Accenture to access systems and data and to perform our services. Client will be responsible to ensure that then current industry-standard virus programs are installed on all Client provided desktops, laptops, servers or other IT equipment provided to Accenture pursuant to this Contract. Client provided equipment including laptops will be provided with all software reasonably required for Accenture to perform the services. Insofar as Client requires Accenture to install Client’s SEED MDM onto Accenture laptops, Client’s security controls/processes would apply to these laptops, and these laptops will be treated as Client-managed laptops as they are not subject to Accenture’s security controls/processes. Compliance with policies Various references in the Requirement Specifications for compliance with government policies, standards and procedures Accenture agrees to comply with relevant Government policies, standards and procedures as agreed between the parties before the Contract is accepted. Compliance with Client’s separate requests, directions and/or guidelines are subject to Accenture’s prior written agreement. Where there are updates to Client’s Government policies, standards and procedures, Client will provide a copy of these so that Accenture may adhere to them. In the event that such updates result in changes to Accenture’s scope, the Parties will mutually discuss via the change control process. Liquidated damages Impact of LDs on liability cap not addressed; Accenture shouldn’t be liable where not at fault. Accenture proposes that liquidated damages would be capped at 10% of the . Liquidated damages (including for service levels) should only be imposed for reasons solely attributable to Accenture and they shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any delay. Liquidated Damages shall not apply, if due to: (i) maintenance performed during any scheduled downtime; (ii) third party applications, hardware, network connectivity or infrastructure, over which Accenture has no control; or (iii) a force majeure event. All liquidated damages under the Contract shall count towards the liability cap and the Client is not entitled to double recovery. Accenture clarifies that security or data breach incidents refers to incidents caused solely by Accenture. The security and data breach procedures are subject to Accenture’s internal policies and processes relating to security and data breach. Accenture will use commercially reasonable endeavours to cooperate and assist Client in relation to a security breach, data breach and vulnerability. Step-in rights No cap to costs for step-in rights. Client may exercise its step-in rights only to the extent that the other source(s) is not an Accenture direct competitor and shall be bound by the confidentiality obligations expressed in the Contract. Recovery of costs by Client for stepping in to carry out and/or complete the services is capped to the actual cost in rectifying the work and our liability cap (whichever is less), and excludes all out-of-scope work. Partial exercise of Tender Include ability to adjust pricing if there is partial acceptance. Pricing Assumptions In case Client accepts Accenture’s Proposal in part, Accenture Personnel While Accenture has provided profiles of proposed resources, the actual project resources to be onboarded would be subject on their availability and commencement date of the project. In any event, Accenture retains full discretion over its resourcing decisions. Accenture may change its personnel without Client’s consent if due to illness, paternity, maternity, national service obligations or cessation of employment (in which case, Accenture will notify Client accordingly). Project governance Including additional time period requirements before step-in, termination or audit. Accenture clarifies that prior to exercising any step-in, termination or audit rights (where applicable to our scope of work), the Parties shall mutually discuss via the project governance and provide Accenture with reasonable notice/cure period. Client’s audits would be limited to authorised project sites. We understand the importance of these audits, and hence wherever possible, we would request for two-week’s prior written notice before an audit is conducted, so as to prepare the necessary to facilitate the audit. Considering the criticality of the business operations, we request that any audit by the client be limited to once per annum,  and we trust that the audit will not be conducted in a manner that will unduly interfere with our business operations or provision of the services to the client. Similarly, we request that any surprise spot checks by the client be limited to a reasonable number of times. For external auditor(s) appointed by the client, they would need to be contractually obliged to maintain the confidentiality of our confidential information and must not be our competitor. So as not to be in breach of our obligations to other clients and vendors, we will not be able to disclose the following: information relating to our other clients or shared service infrastructure or environments; other confidential or sensitive business information that has no bearing about the audit, or which, we cannot lawfully disclose. Any audit conducted by the Authority under this Contract: (a) Shall be subject to at least five (5) calendar days prior written notice to Accenture; (b) Shall be performed during normal business hours of Accenture; (c) Shall be performed without adversely impacting on Accenture’s ability to perform its business, including this Contract (d) when conducted by a third party (other than Auditor-General’s Office), must be subject to such third party signing Contract with the Authority and Accenture for protection of Accenture’s Confidential Information and Accenture IP to which it is provided access and limitation of the right to use such Confidential Information and Accenture IP only for the purpose of this audit; (e) Information shared by Accenture for the purpose of any audit, the audit and the audit results shall be confidential The Authority would accept the system based on the results of the various testing phases. Acceptance of the system should be based on Accenture's contracted scope and not conditional upon events outside of Accenture's control e.g enhancements of any third party or external systems All core team members (e.g. client-facing) for the project would be located onshore in Singapore. Other team members such as Support functions may be located offshore outside of Singapore. Confidentiality No obligations to keep Accenture’s information confidential. Confidentiality obligations under the Contract shall be mutual and parties may retain one copy of information received as required for its internal record-keeping requirements. Personal data Data safeguards To the extent that Accenture will access or process personal data, the Parties will agree beforehand on appropriate processes to facilitate the security of personal data, and Accenture will comply with our obligations as a data intermediary under the Personal Data Protection Act. Accenture’s Data Safeguards and other security-related policies will apply when any data received by Accenture pursuant to the services are stored and processed within Accenture’s systems. Bank Guarantee / security Deposit Clarify expectations on BG based on previous experience Pricing Assumptions Payment Client’s right to withhold payment if value needs to be ascertained The Client be deemed to have accepted the deliverables once they have been put into production, and nothing constitute any excuse for the Client to withhold or request for a refund of payment. Agile Under this Proposal, Accenture shall lead and manage and utilize Accenture Delivery Methods (“ADM”) for Agile (“Agile” or “Agile Methods”) as the overall project approach.  Only high-level scope and requirements are expected to have been identified, and accordingly, the timeline and deliverables will not be fixed and are only an estimation. This project will evolve, and scope will be determined and re-prioritized throughout the term of this Proposal.  Development is iterative and undertaken against business requirements written as user stories expressed from the perspective of end users who express their needs in connection with the system, and further, driven by customer feedback rather than being set against pre-defined and detailed scoping documents. Progress and scope will be managed through Agile Sprint iterations which are time-boxed periods of project work used to design, build, and test project features and seek Client’s acceptance (“Sprints”).  The iterative nature of Sprints will provide an opportunity to continuously measure progress and reprioritize backlog items. The artefacts listed in the scope may be created by Accenture and accepted by Client at multiple intervals throughout the defined Sprints in the course of Agile delivery.  The number and frequency of these artefacts will vary depending on the iteration and release plans as mutually agreed upon between Accenture and Client. Accenture’s proposal would be based on a baseline number of User Stories or Story Points (or equivalent man hours), with a corresponding cap that forms the basis of our pricing, with flexibility for User Stories to be traded in and out provided that the baseline is not exceeded.  In the event the baseline is exceeded, parties will negotiate a scoping prioritization under fixed capacity arrangements. Proposed backlog items will be implemented using commercially reasonable efforts and subject to the available baseline. Some items may be reprioritized for subsequent release, deprioritized, or removed from the backlog pending changing business priorities or other factors such as technical feasibility, risk or cost. A detailed Sprint plan will be mutually agreed at the beginning of each Sprint and will be re-evaluated at the end of each Sprint. Timeline or sprint planning provided in this proposal is based on understanding at epic level without further details into user stories. Hence any variation in timeline due to change in complexity, increase of requirements in user stories may cause changes in sprint planning. The sprint planning illustrated shall be used as high level reference and not for fixed cost, fixed timeline. Resource loading/capacity proposed in this proposal is being used to calculate the required sprints for each module/feature. Any changes to the capacity or sprint plan shall be discussed and mutually agreed, with sufficient notice of minimum 2 months for any increase of decrease of capacity As part of the agile ceremony, backlog planning and grooming, the finalized sprint plan including the scope for each sprint shall be agreed and sign-off by Client. Any delays in the sign-off process may impact the delivery timeline. It is also assumed that at the final sprint of each module, backend integration and testing (UAT) are being considered hence not the entire sprint can be utilized for user stories development. Accenture may receive funding for this project as part of a partner program offered by AWS for the implementation of a Data Warehouse Implementation Service and Data Analytic Application Maintenance Services, hosted on AWS. As part of this program, AWS has agreed to provide a cash investment of up to SGD 50,000 (excluding GST) to Accenture, which will be for the benefit of Client. Accordingly, Accenture has already applied this investment of SGD 50,000 against our initial quoted price, and our current stated contract price is final and already inclusive of this cash investment of SGD 50,000. Client will sign-off the relevant deliverable tied to the AWS Investment expeditiously. Accenture confirms that this paragraph has been included to meet its disclosure obligations under internal policies and this paragraph (including Accenture's receipt or otherwise of the funding) does not affect any rights or obligations of Client.\n",

Client will be responsible for the relationship and contractual obligations with the relevant third party vendors (including any End-User Licence Agreements or Terms of Service, etc). Client will select the products and services including quantity and price, to meet its requirements and Accenture may, on the Client’s written request, help purchase the third party products and services as set out in(collectively “Products”) as the Client’s procurement agent. Accenture’s sole responsibility is to pay the third party vendor after receiving payment from Client and to track and report Product issues and facilitate any workaround or resolution by the relevant vendor. The Client shall, independent of Accenture’s Services, pay Accenture the Product fees as set out , which Accenture’s agency fees, within 30 days upon receiving the Products and related invoice.

Third party vendor may have a direct recourse to Client (if Accenture did not pay third party vendor on time due to failure to have received the sums due by Client to third party vendor) and Client should make related payments. A Vendor-managed update approach means the Cloud Vendor / Cloud Service Provider would automatically update a customer&#x27;s application (and supporting infrastructure) as part of a subscription. Maintenance of the Cloud Service may result in scheduled downtime.

If Subcontractor claims to be exempted from any withholding taxes, it shall inform Accenture and provide any necessary documentation to support the exemption.  Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold Accenture harmless from any deficiency (including penalties and interest) relating to taxes which are the responsibility of Contractor and to reimburse Accenture for all accounting and counsel fees and expenses incurred in connection with an assessment of such a deficiency.  Accenture and Subcontractor shall cooperate in good faith to minimize taxes to the extent legally permissible.
